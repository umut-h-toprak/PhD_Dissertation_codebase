This part of the repository covers the codebase for TMM normalization of RNA-Seq counts described in Section 2.2.11 of the dissertation

Prerequisites:
None

The script rnaEdgerNormalization.sh is designed to work with gzip compreessed read counts where gene identifiers follow the ENSEMBL convention. 
The gene version will be stripped by this script, in order to simplify import into EPISTEME.
