This part of the repository covers the LSF workflow for the SOPHIA breakpoint database generation procedure, described in the Sections 2.2.4 of the dissertation. 

Prerequisites:
A list of files with breakpoint extractions from a series of normal (e.g. blood) sequencing runs (04_01)
In this repository 3 such lists are provided:
a) postSelection_all_290317sorted_100mbfilter_post_merged_higherqual_realPaths (3417 donors), mrefType "merged"
 This is the main list used for the generation of the breakpoint database for SV filtering in SOPHIA
b) postSelection_all_290317sorted_100mbfilter_post_merged_higherqual_realPathsHiseq2000 (2694 donors), mrefType "hiseq2000"
c) postSelection_all_290317sorted_100mbfilter_post_merged_higherqual_realPathsX10 (723 donors), mrefType "x10"
 The per-sequencer-technology lists are for the breakpoint-repeat analysis (04_02_03)
